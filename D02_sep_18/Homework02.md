# Homework


### Evaluate progress
1. Formulate the following:
	- One key term that you understand better after the two first days. 
	- One key term that you still have difficulties  understanding.
	- A number from -10 to 10 indicating the technical pace you think the workshop is taking, where -10 is way too slow and 10 is way too fast. 

	For example: "I still don't understand the key term of variable. I now understand how arrays and dictionaries work. Technical pace: 5.".

2. Post it on Slack in the #homework channel.


### Research
1. Look at existing work in the field of data visualisation. Go to "Project Examples" [here](../References.md) for some places to start, but also do your own google searches.
1. Find one project that strikes you as interesting. Compose a slack post with an image, a link and a text describing:
	- What its goal seems to be.
	- Why it inspires you.
	- One thing you think they have done beautifully.
	- One thing you think they could improve on.

1. Post it on Slack in the #random channel.
