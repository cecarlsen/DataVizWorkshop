# Homework


### Project conceptualisation
Prepare 5 min in-class presentation + individual discusion with tutor. Bring at least one hand-drawn sketch.

See the [project brief](../Assignment_Personal_Project.md).

### Readings
It is time to start reading [the mandatory curriculum](../Readings.pdf) if you didn't already. This may also be inspirational for your project ideation.

### Shader tutorial
I recommend following [this shader tutorial](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-2/) by Jasper Flick at Cat Like Coding. Much of it is a repeat of what we learned in class, but covers additional concepts like how to sample a texture.
