![Splash](Assets/Covid19.jpg)

You guessed it! The theme is pandemic data.

### Brief
You are to conceptualize and prototype a data visualisation project that somehow relates to the theme of pandemic data. You can choose to sample data yourself, or aquire an existing dataset to work with, or do a combination of the two. Some data sources are listed on the [references page](References.md).


### Deadlines

- **Initial idea presentation** Monday September 28th. 
	- Prepare 5 min in-class presentation + indivisual discusion with tutor. Bring at least one hand-drawn sketch.
- **Concept solidification** Tuesday September 29th. 
	- Prepare individual concept presentation/discussion with tutor. 
- **Data acquisition**  Thursday September 29th.
	- You need to have aquired an initial dataset at this point. It is ok if it is not complete, but enough to start parsing it into your program.
- **Functional prototype** Tuesday October 6th (end of day).
- **Presentation** Wednesday October 7th
	- More information on this later.
